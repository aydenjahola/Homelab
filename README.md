# Homelab

This repository contains the configuration and setup files for my personal homelab. My homelab consists of a variety of different hardware and software components, including:

- x4 Dell Optiplex 5060
- TrueNAS SCALE
- Docker
- Traefik
- Nomad

## Goals

The primary goal of my homelab is to provide a platform for learning and experimentation with various technologies. I use it to develop my skills in systems administration, networking, virtualization, containerization, and automation.

Additionally, I use my homelab to host various personal projects and services, such as a personal website, file storage, media streaming, and home automation.

## Setup

The repository contains scripts to automate the setup and configuration of various components of my homelab. This allows for easy replication of the setup across different environments.

## Usage

To use the setup files, clone this repository to your local machine and modify the variables and configurations as needed for your specific environment.

~~For each component, there is a separate directory containing the necessary files for setup. Navigate to the desired directory and run the setup script.~~
Docker Compose dir is not maintained anymore and all my up-to-date configs lives in the Nomad dir.

## Contributing

If you have any suggestions or improvements for my homelab setup, feel free to create a pull request. I welcome any feedback or contributions that can help improve the setup or add new functionality.
