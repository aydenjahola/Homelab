# Homelab - Hephaestus Configs

This repository contains the configuration and setup files for my personal homelab. My homelab consists of a variety of different hardware and software components, including:

- Dell Optiplex
- TrueNAS
- Docker containers
- Traefik
- Nomad

## Goals

The primary goal of my homelab is to provide a platform for learning and experimentation with various technologies. I use it to develop my skills in systems administration, networking, virtualization, containerization, and automation.

Additionally, I use my homelab to host various personal projects and services, such as a personal website, file storage, media streaming, and home automation.

## Setup

The repository contains scripts to automate the setup and configuration of various components of my homelab. This allows for easy replication of the setup across different environments.

The setup files include configurations for the following components:

- Docker
- DashDot
- Portainer
- Pi-Hole
- Pasta
- Plausible
- Portainer
- UptimeKuma

## Usage

To use the setup files, clone this repository to your local machine and modify the variables and configurations as needed for your specific environment.

For each component, there is a separate directory containing the necessary files for setup. Navigate to the desired directory and run the setup script.
